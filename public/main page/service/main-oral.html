                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Oral prophylaxis, also known as dental cleaning, is a preventive dental procedure performed by dental professionals to remove plaque, tartar, and stains from the teeth and gums. This essential service focuses on maintaining optimal oral health and preventing dental issues.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO ORAL PROPHYLAXIS?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Undergoing oral prophylaxis is crucial to prevent dental diseases like cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. Despite regular brushing and flossing, plaque and tartar can accumulate, leading to serious oral health problems. Oral prophylaxis helps eliminate these deposits and prevent future complications</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING ORAL PROPHYLAXIS?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The benefits of oral prophylaxis include preventing dental diseases such as cavities, gingivitis, and periodontal disease. It also improves dental aesthetics by removing surface stains, helps combat bad breath, and contributes to overall well-being by preventing systemic diseases associated with poor oral health.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE ORAL PROPHYLAXIS?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of oral prophylaxis varies depending on individual oral health needs and risk factors. In general, most individuals benefit from biannual (every six months) dental cleanings. However, some individuals with specific conditions or higher risk factors may require more frequent cleanings to maintain optimal oral health.</p>
