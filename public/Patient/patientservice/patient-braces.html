                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The installation of braces involves the attachment of orthodontic devices to the teeth to correct misalignments and achieve a straighter smile. Braces exert gentle pressure on the teeth to gradually move them into proper alignment over time.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO INSTALLATION OF BRACES?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Undergoing the installation of braces is recommended to address various orthodontic issues such as crooked, crowded, or misaligned teeth. It is a common treatment to improve oral health, enhance aesthetics, and prevent potential dental problems associated with misalignments.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING INSTALLATION OF BRACES?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The benefits of having braces are numerous, including improved appearance and self-esteem by achieving a straighter smile, enhanced oral health through easier cleaning and maintenance of aligned teeth, prevention of tooth decay, gum disease, and other dental issues, correction of malocclusion and improvement in speech, prevention of dental injuries and bone erosion, and ultimately, a boost in confidence and overall well-being.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE INSTALLATION OF BRACES?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of appointments for braces installation and adjustments varies depending on individual needs and the type of braces used. Typically, orthodontic visits are scheduled every 4 to 8 weeks for adjustments and progress checks. Regular follow-ups are essential to monitor the teeth movement and ensure the treatment's effectiveness.</p>
