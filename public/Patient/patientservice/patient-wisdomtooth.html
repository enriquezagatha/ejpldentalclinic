                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Removal of impacted wisdom tooth, also known as third molar extraction, is a surgical procedure to remove wisdom teeth that are trapped or stuck under the gum and/or jawbone. Impacted wisdom teeth can cause various dental problems if left untreated.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO REMOVAL OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Removing impacted wisdom tooth is essential to prevent dental issues like decay, gum disease, damage to neighboring teeth, cyst formation, and jaw pain. This extraction helps maintain oral health and prevents complications related to impacted teeth.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING REMOVAL OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Removing impacted wisdom tooth offers several key benefits, including preventing damage to adjacent teeth and reducing orthodontic issues, decreasing the risk of oral diseases like tooth decay and gum inflammation, relieving jaw pain and headaches associated with impaction, improving oral hygiene by facilitating easier cleaning of the area, and enhancing the appearance of the smile by averting overcrowding. </p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE REMOVAL OF IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The need for wisdom tooth removal depends on the individual case. Screening for impacted wisdom teeth often begins in late adolescence when the teeth are still developing. Removal is typically recommended if the teeth are impacted or if there is not enough room for them to grow in properly. Some people may need to have their wisdom teeth removed as a preventive measure before problems occur, while others may only need removal if issues arise later in life.</p>
