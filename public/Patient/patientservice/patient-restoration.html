                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">A dental restoration is a treatment to repair a damaged or decayed tooth and restore its function and appearance. Common types of dental restorations include fillings, crowns, bridges, inlays, on lays, and dental implants1.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO DENTAL RESTORATION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">If you have decayed, damaged, missing, or worn-down teeth, you may require dental restoration. This process aims to repair and restore damaged teeth, enhancing not only your oral health but also the functionality and aesthetics of your smile.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING DENTAL RESTORATION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Dental restorations offer a range of benefits, including the repair of damaged or decayed teeth to prevent further deterioration, restoration of chewing function and the ability to eat comfortably, enhancement of the appearance of one's smile, prevention of tooth loss, and maintenance of the natural shape of the face.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE DENTAL RESTORATION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of dental restorations varies depending on factors such as the type of restoration, the number of teeth needing treatment, the size of the restoration, and individual oral health and caries risk. Generally, fillings may need replacement every 5-10 years, crowns and bridges can last 10-15 years with proper care, and dental implants can last a lifetime with good oral hygiene. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings every 6 months are crucial for early problem detection and maintaining restorations, with patients at higher caries risk potentially requiring more frequent monitoring.</p>
