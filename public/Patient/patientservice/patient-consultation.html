                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">A dental consultation is an appointment with a dentist to assess the health of your teeth, gums, and mouth. It typically includes an oral examination, cleaning, and discussions about any concerns or potential treatments.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO DENTAL CONSULTATION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Dental consultations are important for preventing and managing oral health issues like tooth decay, gum disease, and oral cancer. They allow dentists to closely monitor your oral health and catch any problems early.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING DENTAL CONSULTATION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Regular Dental consultations offer numerous benefits, including the prevention and treatment of DENTAL problems such as cavities and gum disease, improvement of overall health due to the interconnectedness of oral health with the rest of the body, maintenance of a healthy and attractive smile while preventing tooth loss, early identification and treatment of oral cancer, and reduction of the need for more extensive and costly DENTAL treatments in the future.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE DENTAL CONSULTATION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of dental consultations depends on individual risk factors, with low-risk patients typically requiring annual consultations and high-risk patients benefiting from consultations every 3-4 months. Most adults are advised to have consultations at least twice a year, while children should undergo consultations every 6 months to monitor development and prevent cavities. Consulting with your dentist is crucial for determining the optimal frequency tailored to your specific oral health needs.</p>
