                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Dental Prosthesis, also known as dental prosthesis, are artificial dental replacements used to restore the function and appearance of missing or damaged teeth. They come in various types, including removable dentures, partial dentures, fixed prosthetic like crowns and bridges, and implant-supported dentures</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO DENTAL PROSTHESIS?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Undergoing Dental Prosthesis is essential for restoring dental functionality, aesthetics, and overall oral health. It is recommended for individuals who have lost natural teeth due to decay, injury, or other reasons, as it helps in improving chewing ability, speech, and self-confidence.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING DENTAL PROSTHESIS?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Having dental prosthesis offers a range of benefits, including the restoration of dental functionality by enabling individuals to chew normally, improving digestion, and allowing them to eat without concern for damaging their teeth. Furthermore, dental prosthetics contribute to a radiant smile, enhancing self-confidence and providing a fresher, younger appearance. Speech enhancement is another advantage, as dentures aid in pronouncing words clearly, restoring self-assurance in social interactions. Additionally, dental prosthetics play a crucial role in preventing bone loss in the jaw and providing stability, further supporting overall oral health and well-being.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE DENTAL PROSTHESIS?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of needing dental prosthesis services varies depending on individual needs and the type of prosthesis used. Generally, regular check-ups with your dentist are recommended to ensure proper fit and function of the prosthetic. Daily cleaning and maintenance are crucial for the longevity and effectiveness of dental prosthetic.</p>
