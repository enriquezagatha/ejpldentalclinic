                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">A jacket crown, also known as a dental crown, is a tooth-shaped cap that covers a damaged or weakened tooth. It is typically made of materials like porcelain, ceramic, or zirconia and is used to restore the function and appearance of a tooth that has been compromised by decay, large fillings, or damage.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO JACKET CROWN</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">You may need a jacket crown if you have a tooth with extensive decay, a large filling, or damage that weakens the tooth. This service is recommended to protect and strengthen the tooth, restore its natural shape and function, and enhance the overall appearance of your smile.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING JACKET CROWN</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The benefits of having jacket crowns include the restoration of function by strengthening weakened teeth, enabling normal biting and chewing. Additionally, they enhance the appearance of your smile by closely matching the color, shape, and alignment of your natural teeth. Jacket crowns are durable, offering longevity of up to 30 years with proper care, providing long-term protection for the treated tooth. Moreover, they can provide pain relief by alleviating discomfort from issues like tooth decay, fractures, or sensitivity, ultimately enhancing overall oral health and comfort.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE JACKET CROWN</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of needing a jacket crown service varies depending on individual dental health. In general, jacket crowns are a long-term solution and can last for many years. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene practices can help maintain the longevity of the crown. It is essential to follow your dentist's recommendations for check-ups and maintenance to ensure the crown's effectiveness and longevity.</p>
