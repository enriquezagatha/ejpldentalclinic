                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Tooth extraction is a dental procedure that involves the permanent removal of a tooth from its socket in the jaw bone. It can be necessary for various reasons such as severe decay, impacted wisdom teeth, orthodontic treatment, periodontal disease, fractures, infections, or traumatic injuries</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU UNDERGO TOOTH EXTRACTION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Tooth extraction may be necessary to address issues like severe tooth decay that cannot be restored, impacted wisdom teeth causing pain or infection, misalignment requiring orthodontic treatment, advanced gum disease, fractures, infections, or traumatic injuries. It is essential to prevent further complications and maintain oral health.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING TOOTH EXTRACTION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The benefits of tooth extraction include achieving smile goals by addressing overcrowding, relieving pain caused by damaged teeth, saving the surrounding teeth from infection, and removing the root of the problem when damage is irreversible. It can also promote faster healing and recovery, prevent complications, and improve overall oral health and well-being.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO HAVE TOOTH EXTRACTION?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">The frequency of tooth extraction depends on individual dental needs. While it is typically a last resort, it may be necessary when other treatments are not viable. The need for tooth extraction is determined by the dentist based on the specific dental condition and can vary from one-time extractions to multiple extractions over time as needed for oral health maintenance.</p>
